Restricted contacts are created by the Facebook sync adapter. These
contacts are accessible to a whitelist of applications, which is specified
and enforced by Facebook.
The restricted contact API is private and I haven't heard of any plans to
open it up, which means that nobody (with the exception of Facebook) should
be using it at this point. In any case, the way it is implemented only
allows for a single restricted account.
