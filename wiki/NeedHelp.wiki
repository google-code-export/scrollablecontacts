#summary Need Help...

= Introduction =

Thx for your interest in helping me:


= Photoshoppers / Gimpers =

I currently need:
  * a new icon for the widget because the one I am currently using is to shiny for a simple "contact picture not found" icon.
  * a set of new backgrounds in black and white both with and without a seperated space for the header (widget label) (so 4 images in summery ;) ) because I don't like the title floating around in the nowhere...
