#summary launcher- and widget-developer guide to API version 2
#labels Deprecated,Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

Hi there everyone,

I've worked the last week on a new scrollable widget API which is much more flexible then the previous one. This document might help you all to use these changes.
Here some things that are new:

=== Metadata requirements ===

As a widget dev you can now add some nodes to your AndroidManifest.xml to tell the launcher that you need a specific API version or that your widget needs to be scrollable or animated. Read more about it in the two dev sections ;)

=== RemoteViews ===

The ListViews / GridViews and its content can now be described by two variants of RemoteViews which brings much more flexibility to the widget development. More about it in the widget dev section!

= For launcher devs =

As you see in the Launcher.java from the L+ code I have added some "meta-data-checks" in the addAppWidget method.

There currently is only the check for the API version. 
But in the new LauncherMetadata.java are some other "metadata names" defined.
You should check them too if they are relevant for your launcher!

For example:
If you have a setting to enable/disable scrollable widget support then you might check the
LauncherMetadata.Requirements.Scrollable meta-data too. If that meta-data is set to true the widget needs scrollable support. You might ask the user if he / she wants to enable that setting if it is disabled or also drop the widget.

Please do us widget devs a favor and tell the user why you don't add a widget. This would reduce the amount of unnecessary support requests we have to answer ;)

So please read the changes I've done in the Launcher.java try to understand them and do what you have to do ;)
